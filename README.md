# Predicting Student Math Performance: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict student math performance and identify key influencing factors. Using the Students Performance dataset from Kaggle, we developed a Stacking Regressor model that achieved an RÂ² score of 0.8632, explaining 86.32% of the variance in math scores.

## Key Findings
The top five factors influencing math performance were identified as:
1. Reading Score (Importance: 0.42)
2. Writing Score (Importance: 0.38)
3. Parental Level of Education (Importance: 0.09)
4. Test Preparation Course Completion (Importance: 0.06)
5. Lunch Type (Importance: 0.05)

## Methodology
This project followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology, leveraging the capabilities of Claude, an AI assistant, for data analysis and machine learning tasks.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Claude AI Assistant

## Future Directions
- Conduct longitudinal studies to track the impact of interventions over time
- Investigate causal relationships between key factors and math performance
- Develop personalized learning path recommendations based on model predictions

## Ethical Considerations
This README acknowledges the ethical implications of using predictive models in education. The model should be used as a tool to support, not replace, educator judgment. Regular audits for bias and fairness should be conducted, and student privacy must be rigorously protected in any implementation of this model.
